    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about how and why I have changed several different schools for many different reasons. </strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >I have been to about six schools, including nurseries, schools and colleges, but excluding the university from this. I have attended one nursery, four schools and one college for the sixth form. I left all the different schools for multiple of various reasons. </p>
<p align="center" >The nursery I went to was great for me, and it was much better to go to the nursery with my twin brother. Although I did not make many friends, I had my brother there for the friendships I needed. I didn't make friends because I had speech and walking difficulties, and I could not make many friends because I always needed someone (like a teacher) to help me through the day. It would have been hard to talk to me with an adult present.</p>
<p align="center" >The first school I went to was huge because the school educates people from Reception to Year 13. This school was a private school with a range of diverse people and was a girls' school. I started in the school at Reception and left after Year 1. I did not have my Kaye Walker in this school, so I couldn't move around that easily or make many friends easily. However, everyone tried to help and talk to me around the playground. I left the school because it was hard for my mum to get to my brother's and my school. After all, going to the different schools was a more extended trip. Another reason I left the school was because I did not make many friends whilst being there, and I did not have much support. </p>
<p align="center" >After the first private school, the second school I went to was near the first school I went to. I went to the second school, where my brothers went, whilst I was at my first school. This school was smaller than my previous school, but it was still significant since it went from nursery to Year 8. The school was a private primary school which had a range of many people and was a mixed school, full of many boys and girls. After finishing Year 1 at my previous school, I started in the school in Year 2 till Year 6. I enjoyed this school a lot.</p>
<p align="center" >In Year 2, when I started, I didn't have a person to care for me, but I did have help along the way. During breaks/lunch breaks, I sat on the bench near the classroom and read the books beside the bench, making it easy to return to class. This was also easier because I could not walk around the playground without falling. All the lessons were straightforward for all of us to understand. Although I had many friends in school, I didn't have my Walker while being there because my confidence grew greatly during school. </p>
<p align="center" > I was in middle school in Year 3 and Year 4. In Year 3, I had a Learning Support Assistant (LSA), one of my friends (in my age group) mother. They helped me with many things, like helping me move around and supporting me in class, e.g. taking notes. The different classrooms in Year 3 and Year 4 were up the stairs, so the school had a lift, which was great for me to go up. The lift was only used by people who had different abilities. For Year 3 and Year 4, I had my Walker used to walk and support me in various scenarios so I could move around the playground and make friends easily. During breaks/lunch breaks, I moved around with my friends without any support from the LSA. Still, if I had fallen, I would have been greatly helped by all the teachers, the older people, and my friends on the playground. When I reached Year 4, I took an afterschool activity of learning Spanish with a different Year 4 teacher, but I didn't have my LSA there. While in these year groups, I mostly stayed in the library (near my classroom) during my break times.</p>
<p align="center" >In years 5 and 6, I got into another stage of middle school; this school, I had a different Learning Support Assistant (LSA), who was one of my other friends (in my year group) mother who helped me with many kinds of things, like helping me to move around and support me in class, e.g. taking notes. In years 5 and 6, I used my Walker to support me, move around in the playground, and keep my friends from the previous year by making new friends. In Year 5, I was in the classroom, down the stairs from where I was in Year 3 and Year 4, so I didn't need to use the lift because my classroom was on the ground floor of the building. In Year 5, I had an English teacher as my form tutor and was in an English classroom. Year 5 was easier for me because my confidence and kindness had grown, and to learn everything in the different schools. In Year 6, I was in another class with many other people. Year 6 was in the French style, where I didn't have my Walker because to go to the course, we had to go up four steps to get inside the building, then walk along the corridor to enter the classroom. The form tutor of our class was my favourite French teacher and form tutor because she allowed me to go to school during the breaks and lunch breaks. Colour printed drawings when I didn't want to spend any time outside. </p>
<p align="center" >I was with a different range of people in each class, around 24 - 30. I moved around the diverse classrooms for my various subjects in this school. It was a long distance for me to walk to the classes, so I needed someone to support me and help me with my school bag, which I did have. The maths and drama departments were in the school's central part. The maths department was up the stairs of the building, and the drama department was down the stairs of the building. The music, French, history, welsh, Religious Studies/Education (RS/RE), and English departments were upstairs in the building with the most classes. The Geography department was in the topics where the Year 4 students were. The art department was near the front part of where I had entered to go into the dining room and where we went to go into the school. In Physical Education (P.E.), the girls were doing different sports than the boys; the other girls in the school played hockey, netball, rounders and other sports. Still, I didn't play the same sports as the girls. I rode my tricycle around the playground, walked around the fields, played rounders with a tennis racket instead of a rounders bat, and played basketball with a shorter net height and a softer basketball so I wouldn't get hurt much played with the climbing equipment.</p>
<p align="center" >I left this school after Year 6 because I needed to go to the secondary on time, like everyone else. I also needed to make many friends at the start because if I had started secondary school in Year 9, I wouldn't have made enough friends since I had a disability and many different abilities. This school was great since I was given a lot of support, and my brothers were there with me, so it was excellent and helpful for me to be in this school.</p>
<p align="center" >After Year 6, I moved to a different school close to my second school. The school was secondary and private, the last private school I had gone to. This school was a girls' school, which had about 300 students altogether within the school. The school was also a boarding school and a performing arts school. There were around 24 people in each class and two classes each year. There were many classes in different places of the school. The school was huge, some of my classes were upstairs, and some were on the school's ground floor, including History, Geography and Drama; the boarding part of the school was also up the stairs. There were many subjects on the ground floor: Art, I.T, Maths, R.E., English, Music, Dance, P.E. and Citizenship. I started this school in Year 7, where I studied many subjects more in-depth.</p>
<p align="center" >The performing arts school had the art subjects of dance, drama, art and music. In this school, I had an LSA, a gym teacher who helped me in some of my lessons. Most of the performing studies were hard for me to learn and participate in these lessons' activities. There were two parts to the entire school and stairs to the second part of the school, so I had to go all the way around the school to get to my classes in the second part. I mostly used my wheelchair during lesson time because moving around was easier and quicker. It was also so it would be easier and safer for my LSA, which was not enjoyable for me. Although, I used my Walker to move around during breaks, lunchtimes, and my P.E. and dance classes. This was because I wanted to move around and stretch my legs.</p>
<p align="center" >I had a range of ways to support me in each of my lessons in the different classes, but I didn't have much support from my LSA in some tasks. My music, drama, art, information technology and dance lessons were in the main building near the Main Reception. Two libraries were near this, and the outside garden was filled with beautiful flowers. The two libraries were where the people in Year 7 had their form tutor sessions (PSCHE and Registration). Although my Year 8 form rooms changed a lot since the Year 8 classes I was in had many people during the year. </p>
<p align="center" >Sometime during Year 8, my English tutor told my parents that I could get an EHCP (Education, Health, Care) Plan for my disability. My parents thought I should go to a different school that is more equipped to deal with the different abilities and a school that supports giving a bit of independence. We started looking at many schools in my home town so that it would be a rapid journey to the school. We looked at schools that were good with disabilities but were not in academics from the school. Although this school was great for the support given, my parents and I agreed that it would be best to look for somewhere where I could finish my GCSEs in Year 11 at the same time as all my other friends. So we looked at a few different schools until we found the right one. It was beneficial and quite refreshing to find a school in this town with enough support to help me and the applicable academic requirement to ensure I can finish my GCSEs in Year 11 when I turn 16.</p>
<p align="center" >I went to this school in Year 9 when I was 14. I enjoyed this school a lot. In July of the year before, I visited and talked to the head of the learning support team, where we talked about my grades, abilities, and EHCP Plan. I also got told that I would have a Learning Support Assistant who would be there for whatever I needed help with. On that day and everything else, I got to go into a lesson with a student and see how well it would be for me. It was amazing, I met a few great people, and the teachers were very welcoming. </p>
<p align="center" >I started school in September 2016 on my first day at this new school. I was nervous, scared, and slightly excited (I guess how anyone is when going to a new school). I sat near the door in each class; all classes were on the ground floor but in different buildings, although the buildings were quite close. My first form room, which I was in, was in a separate building from my classes and where my LSA was. So, I spent a few days in that class while the head of the LSA department asked me to be moved to another form class closer to my LSA. I had made a few friends in my first form class, but not many; I had made more friends in the new form class. Although, the best part of my new form room was that it was near the institution unit (room 4), where the LSA department was. </p>
<p align="center" >In Year 9, I discovered I wanted to study I.T. and Computer Science. I found this out because a Youth Connections lady had come to help me figure out what I wanted to do with my future. She then gave me a link to a website which allows people with their computing skills.</p>
<p align="center" >In this school, I spent a lot of time in the Institution Unit; during break time and the lunch break, I was the only one allowed to eat in the Institution Unit because I couldn't go into the dining hall with it was so busy. My Walking Frame not being able to fit through the hallways. Therefore, I brought packed lunch to school every day (which I didn't mind). I also spent time in the Institution Unit during classes when I wasn't feeling terrific and in P.E. class to play Boccia (a sport like the French game of Boules). I would also play Boccia outside of the gym where everyone else from the year was; as well as playing Boccia, I played basketball with a shorter net and a softer ball to not hurt myself. I met most of my friends in the Institution Unit, where we had a good time talking, using the computers and doing some work or colouring. Most of my significant moments in this school were in the Institution Unit with my friends. I mainly met people with dyslexia in this room. Still, many people came in for laptops with broken/dislocated arms.</p>
<p align="center" >Although, in my classes, I tried to use a laptop for the first two weeks, after the teachers and I learnt that a scribe or handouts would be better for taking notes. So I could absorb all the information with the satisfaction of taking notes home to read/revise. For the tests/exams, I got the chance to do them in a different room (away from the class) because I had a scribe to write the answers, a reader to read the questions to me so I could understand and extra time which I needed to understand and answer each of the questions. My LSA helped me through all my lessons and tests, but if she were not there, another LSA would help me during my studies. So I never felt or was alone. Although they did leave me alone during a break to make new friends, there was always at least one teacher nearby if I needed help. </p>
<p align="center" >All my lessons were on the ground floor. Although, if they weren't, they would have to be moved and would move with the help of the head of the LSA department. I used my Walking Frame in this school, significantly increasing my independence and confidence. I used my Frame and wheelchair for most of Year 9, but after Year 9, in Years 10 and 11, I used my walking frame, which was very handy for getting to different places. Although sometimes, I did fall onto my Frame or while walking (when I did fall, it frequently hurt severely, and a few times, I would start crying). However, it was rarely that bad; I liked to be in my Walker, not to be restricted. When we had all our school trips, I went in my wheelchair because the teachers said there'd be a lot of walking. During Year 11, we had many exams to prepare for GCSEs. We had more revision periods in our groups/classes. This school taught me a lot about having confidence in myself, being open to new people, and, most importantly, this school increased my independence by milestones. In Year 11, I also met with the Youth Connections lady to discuss what I wanted to do after secondary school. I decided to go to a nearby college to study BTEC I.T. Diploma. This was because I had a passion for I.T. and Computer Science.</p> 
<p align="center" >In May 2019 (before GCSE exams), we had our prom. At first, I wasn't sure about going because I was scared of choking on the roast chicken (that was dinner). In March/April, the head of our year asked me why I wasn't going (obviously, I told her the reason). She then communicated with my mum, and they realized it would be easier for me to eat the school teacher's food. So, I had to go shopping for a dress and shoes, with my mum and aunt. We found a short royal blue dress and a pair of platform shoes (like sneakers), which I loved. On the prom day, I entered the big hall and went to my seating place, although this was the main issue. The problem was that I couldn't get up and dance (tbh, I love dancing) because I had been sitting at the right corner table, and all the tables were in the way, so I couldn't walk over to the dance floor without hitting something with my walker.</p><p align="center" >In July 2019, after completing my GCSEs, I went to the college for an open day and met the learning support tutors. I started college in September 2019, which began a new chapter of my life. On the first day of that year, we were put into our groups and made small friend groups; we also met our teachers and learned more about the course. I was in the Level 3 I.T. Subsidiary Diploma Group B. In the first year, I had lunch in the downstairs area where I bought lunch from the canteen, which was filled with delicious food, my LSA stayed with me during lunch, so I wouldn't choke or be the hazard of choking. I also made many friends with special needs in the year, but some people also left the college or course to do other things. This year, they also got a new roller chair with a suitable backrest a sturdy arm supports. I borrowed a laptop to use with the chair during lessons and at home for any assignments we had.</p> 
<p align="center" >I used my Walker a lot, but I also took my wheelchair on the trips because they told us that there would be many walking around to areas. I ate in the classroom in the second year because I wanted to be more independent without my LSA. I wanted to try and avoid the Covid-19 Virus and the crowd by not eating in the canteen area. Although, I did enjoy eating packed lunches because my friends would bring their lunches, and we would all talk together. In that year, I made many great friends. In the second year, every time I was in college, I used to speak to my Future Coach online, who helped me to decide what I wanted to do after college. I finally found out, what I wanted to do, but it did take a long time because there were so many things that I wanted to do. Though I felt like I wanted to go further in my education, I started applying to universities in Computer Science.</p>
<p align="center" >I got conditional offers from all of my choice universities, and I had finally decided to go to the university closest to my home.​</p>
