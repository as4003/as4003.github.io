<p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Spain when I went to Valencia for a week with my brothers.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 19, my brothers and I went on our first trip without our parents. I took my wheelchair to not be very slow for my brothers (not to try to hold them back). We were staying in an Airbnb while in Valencia. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home, and my parents dropped us off at the train station to catch the train to go to the airport; it was exhilarating (but I was also a bit anxious about how I would cope without my parents), I used the wheelchair throughout the entire trip. Once we arrived at the airport, we checked in and relaxed till boarding the flight. We also got a chance to grab some snacks and food to get ready for the flight.</p>
<p align="center" >Once getting onto the flight, we sat together, where we were able to enjoy the flight together and sit together when listening to music and relaxing. When we reached the Valencia airport, we got a taxi to get to the AirBnB (in the taxi, we had to wear a mask, which was quite uncomfortable); the AirBnB was up a flight of stairs and took me a while to get into the AirBnB, which was very comfortable. There were two bedrooms in the AirBnB, I slept in one room with a single bed, and my brothers slept in the other room with a double bed. There was also a sitting area and kitchen area outside of our rooms.</p>
<p align="center" >We left the AirBnB to go sightseeing; we first decided to get lunch from the market and then went to the Botanica Gardens. We spent some time (over an hour) looking at the different plants in the Botanica Gardens, where we could see all the colourful plants, with the chance to see a gallery of photos of different kinds of plants. We took many pictures and images of us in the Gardens and had a great time.</p>
<p align="center" >Once we left the Botanica Gardens, we went to a restaurant near the Airbnb to eat dinner and enjoy eating fish. We finished dinner and returned to the apartment, where we saw some insulting people who made many rude comments about me being in the wheelchair. So, we brought the wheelchair to the apartment for the safety of the wheelchair. Once we reached the apartment, we all went into our rooms to sleep. </p> 
<p align="center" >On the second day, we woke up and left our rooms for breakfast. We ate in the apartment and left for the museum and gallery to look at the historical images and artefacts. We spent above an hour in the museum, where we got a chance to look around the museum. We saw a lot of photos and images of the life of Jesus. After spending 2 hours there, we left for lunch at the market and drank at a local bar, where we also saw the scenery. Then, we went to the art museum to see all the paintings. We left after an hour to go to dinner to eat paella nearby the apartment, where we saw a school going on a school trip. Later on, we left to go back to the apartment to fall asleep.</p>
<p align="centre" >On the third day, we left the apartment to go to the marine museum, where we saw the largest skeleton of the giant blue whale while reading the information and images of different marine animals. When leaving the museum, we went through the market to go and find some food to eat; then we went to find a place to eat, where we found some scenery. We then had a drink somewhere nearby and left for dinner and a snack at another restaurant. Once we left dinner, we went back to the apartment, where we played some drinking games and had a great time.</p>
<p align="center" >On the fourth day, we woke up at 11 am because we had fallen asleep late the previous night. When waking up, we had a big breakfast(that my brothers made for us), huevos rancheros (a black bean and avocado wrap), which was very filling to eat and very delicious. We ate at 1 pm, which was good and gave me a bit more energy. We finished our meal at 2 pm, and we then went for a walk around the area of Valencia.</p>
<p align="center" >Finally, we reached the shopping centre, collecting a few bottles of drinks and some sodas with juices. We then returned to the apartment, where we ate some snacks and sat down to enjoy ourselves by playing card games and drinking drinks. We went to sleep earlier to get a chance and pack for the flight the next day.</p>
<p align="center" >On the last day, we woke up, relaxed, and packed till 11 in the morning. After we left the apartment, we went to a cafe to eat and relax till travelling to the airport to get ready for the flight, where we headed back home. </p>
<p align="center" >I had a great holiday travelling with my brothers. Most of all, I enjoyed talking to my brothers about many different topics and having fun with them. </p>
