  <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Kenya when my family and grandparents went to Kenya for a few weeks and what we did while being there.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 19, me and my family went to Kenya. I took my walker to be able to walk with my family instead of feeling like another carry-on. We had already planned what we wanted to do and where to go. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to drive to the airport. At the airport, we unloaded our bags; then, my parents left to pick up one of my aunts, who would be travelling with us. Meanwhile, my brothers and grandparents waited for my parents to arrive at a cafe. Once they arrived, we all made our way to the check-in, where somebody told us to go into the fast lane; we then checked in and headed to the security check. After the security check, we went to Costa to get a drink and do some shopping, then we boarded the flight, where somebody told us we could get into the plane first (to support me).  </p>
<p align="center" >Once we got onto the plane, we saw movies, TV shows and games on the screen for us to relax during the flight. We didn't get to sit beside each other, but we were near our family. I felt nervous and scared about sitting away from my family, but my mum sat on the other aisle seat next to me. We arrived at the Nairobi Airport in over 8 hours, where we got the bags and headed outside to get a few sims to use our phones. We met up with two people and two vans, by family friends.</p>
<p align="center" >For the first night, we stayed at our family friend's house in Nairobi, my grandma stayed at her friend's house, and my other grandparents stayed at a relative's house. We arrived at 8 am and were all so tired, so we relaxed briefly. Then, my twin went to a friend's house to relax, and my eldest brother went to his friend's house while I hung out there. After a bit, all the adults left, and I was left alone, so I dressed and watched TV to pass the time. That evening, we met up with a few more of my parent's friends for dinner, and we separated into kids and adults, where we talked. After we left, we headed back and packed for the next day.</p>
<p align="center" > We woke up early to prepare to leave for Masai Mara National Park the next day. We had a quick breakfast full of fruits and cereal. After breakfast, we returned to our rooms to get our bags ready to leave. We met my grandma and friends who were coming with us. We left in two minibuses to go to the meeting point for Masai Mara. We stopped along the way for snacks and lunch until we got to the Campsite, where we were greeted by hot towels and the counsellor telling us the information and rules of the camp. Then, we went for a pleasant lunch with a lot of vegetables, and somebody showed us the menu for the next four days; later, we went to our tents/huts, where we stayed. The tents/huts were quite big, with a double and single bed and a large bathroom with a shower, which was quite useful. </p> 
<p align="center" >The rooms were assigned; my parents shared a room, my brothers had a room, and I shared a room with my grandma. After unloading our bags, we had dinner full of vegetables and protein. Once we finished eating dinner, we talked briefly and went to our tents/huts to sleep and relax. We had an early night to get rest to be ready for the next day. </p>
<p align="center" >On the days after, we saw many animals, like lions, leopards, cheetahs, zebras, elephants, giraffes, bulls, hippos, crocodiles, baboons and deers. We were asked to be quiet and still when viewing the animals because we could have scared the animals. We also had good lunches while going to look at animals. While looking at animals, we got the chance to take pictures. On one of the days, we were fortunate to see two cheetahs hunting down a deer; we were also fortunate to see and get a video of a lioness jumping over a stream. There were two trucks to take us on this adventure. On another day, our truck got stuck; fortunately, we got out of the trap, but I got very muddy by this. I was not too fond of the truck drives (I felt they were very unsafe), but our drivers were cautious on the road.</p> 
<p align="center" >We left for Nairobi four days after arriving. The drive back was very uncomfortable, but we got to take rest stops. At one of the stops, my dad went to a part of Kenya (where he grew up) while we all returned to Nairobi. Once we arrived in Nairobi, we unloaded all our bags, and then my brothers left to go to a friend's house while I spent the night resting there. I felt I needed a big sleep. This was to be able to get ready for the next day, and I went to bed.</p>
<p align="center" >The next day, we woke up at 8 am to get enough sleep; my brothers had slept at their friend's house. When we finished breakfast, my mum went to the Masai market with her friend to buy earrings. Then, we went to the town centre to buy Indian dresses and jewellery from a family member. We finished shopping and then returned to the house to get dressed for dinner, which I spent with my parents, grandparents and family members where my grandparents were staying. Meanwhile, my brothers were having dinner with their friends and, after, were going out. I was planning to go out with them but was exhausted (I even fell asleep when I got to the house). That night, my brothers spent the night at their friend's houses. The day after, I went bowling with my brothers and friends, and then we went to one of their houses to play tennis and chill, with the key to relaxing. Afterwards, I returned to the house to pack for the next weeks and the beach holidays. My brothers both fell asleep at their friend's houses. </p>
<p align="centre" >The day later, we woke up at 7 am to prepare for the flight to a beach-front resort in Mombasa. Once we had packed, we had some time to relax while my dad went to pick up my brothers, and we left for the airport. While waiting at the airport with my family, we got the chance to play card games. After a bit, we were able to board the flight and got onto the plane. We arrived in Mombasa while it was raining and went under the shelter. We grabbed the bags and then headed to a taxi/minibus to get to the hotel.</p>
<p align="center" >We were welcomed and guided to our rooms once we got to the hotel. After we had a chance to look around, there were two pools, a kid pool (which we didn't use) and a pool with a bar (where we were most of the time). We saw that there were many water-based and beach activities. We were in the pool most of the time; we also went to the cafes around the hotel and dining restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I only went to the beach once because I was scared, and as we headed to the ocean, there was a large and steep hill of rock, which could have made me trip, so I had to be very cautious. Luckily, everything was included in this hotel, which was much better for us.  </p>
<p align="center" >We left the hotel in Mombasa after six days, where we got a taxi to take us to the border of Mombasa to meet my dad's cousin and mum's family friend, where we entered their apartment to have lunch. We then headed to another beach resort in Watamu to meet family friends. The Watamu Hotel had two swimming pools, and the others played cricket on the beach. This hotel was not exclusive; on one night, we went to a dance club, where we enjoyed ourselves, and on another night, we split up into parents and kids, where the kids went to play some games in the boy's room. After a few days, we left the hotel and returned to Nairobi, where we spent a night and headed back home to the UK. </p>
<p align="center" >This was a great visit, where we saw many animals and spent time with our grandparents and family friends. I would highly recommend this trip to experience wildlife and a beach atmosphere, which was like having a holiday with the best of both worlds. </p>
