<p align="center" > <strong>This is about how my parents and I did the Thames Bridges Trek with my wheelchair.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >We did this for a charity via the ultra challenge website. It was a 25 km walk, covering 16 bridges. We got T-shirts with the name of the Thames Bridge Trek on it. My parents left early from home to go onto the train, where we saw many people who would be doing the adventure. Once we reached the train station, we went to the starting point of the Trek, where we got a map.</p>
<p align="center" >Once we reached the starting point, we took photos of ourselves and talked about the walk till the marker for the starting of the Trek went off. We travelled along the bridges, where I got pushed and wheeled myself in a wheelchair. Once the Trek started, we travelled to the first bridge, the Putney Bridge. There were many stairs along the way, and at each staircase, I got out of the wheelchair to walk down the flight of stairs; after I got down safely, I got back into the wheelchair</p>
<p align="center" >These are all the bridges we visited, The Putney Bridge, The Fulham Railway Bridge, The Wandsworth Bridge, The Battersea Bridge, The Albert Bridge, The Chelsea Bridge, The Vauxhall Bridge, The Lambeth Bridge, The Westminster Bridge, The Golden Jubilee (Hungerford) Bridge, The Waterloo Bridge, The Blackfriars Bridge, The Millenium Bridge, The Southwark Bridge, The London Bridge and The Tower Bridge. On the way, we took many scenery pictures, with many rest breaks, and had some ice cream near the park. </p>
<p align="center" >We finished the Bridge Trek in last place (but we were delighted to have built up our strength). Despite coming in last place, we were very proud of ourselves for finishing this. Once we reached the finishing line, we were given our medals with a cup of prosecco, and then we were told that we could rest for a bit and have a cupcake. After, we left to go back to the train station to go home. </p>
<p align="center" >I was thrilled to have finished this Trek; it helped me gain strength and the confidence to know I could do it.</p>
