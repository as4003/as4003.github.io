    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Spain when I went to Tenerife for a week with my family.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 18, my brothers and parents went on our first trip after Covid. I took my walker to walk myself (but I normally sat on the seat on the walker, which took more time). We were staying in an Airbnb while in Tenerife. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to get to the airport; it was very exciting. It was a bit scary to be on the plane with everyone. As soon as we arrived at the airport, we checked in and relaxed till boarding the flight. We also got a chance to grab some snacks and food to get ready for the flight.</p>
<p align="center" >Once getting onto the flight, we sat together, where we could have a good flight together while relaxing. When we reached Tenerife airport, my dad left to get a car from the car rental while we looked after the bags and got ready to leave. We reached the AirBnB in about an hour; in the afternoon, after leaving the airport(in the car, with my dad driving), the AirBnB was huge and had an outdoor swimming pool with a comfortable seating area around the swimming pool, with many bedrooms, both upstairs and downstairs, which was very comforting. There were three bedrooms in the AirBnB; I slept in one room while sharing a wall with my parents' room. While my brothers went to sleep, I went up the stairs (I chose not to go upstairs because I feared falling over). There was also a sitting area, a dining area and a kitchen area outside the rooms.</p>
<p align="center" >We left the AirBnB; after looking around the AirBnB, we first decided to go get some dinner from the local nearby restaurant, where we ate mozzarella and tomato salad with seafood and red wine; we spent about 2 hours there while talking about different topics. Later, we decided to walk back to the AirBnB (which was hard for me, so my brothers had to help by pushing me). Once we reached the AirBnB, we all went to bed and fell asleep after the long day. </p>
<p align="center" > The next day, we decided to have a lie-in and woke up later; my parents left to get some food from the supermarket for breakfast. We ate bread, croissants, fruits, and dips of jam and Nutella for breakfast. After breakfast, we all relaxed briefly, went swimming and had fun. Later on, we went to the town centre to see the scenery and get drinks with snacks. Once we had eaten dinner, at the restaurant in the town centre, near the beach. After we finished dinner, we went shopping for different kinds of things. Me and my mum left to go to the car, while my brothers and dad did the shopping. Once we all got into the car, we drove to the Airbnb and went to bed. </p> 
<p align="center" >On the third day, we woke up at a later time and went to eat some breakfast. I went to get a puzzle from the game cupboard and get ready to go swimming. We went into the swimming pool and chilled out outside of the swimming pool. After showering and getting dressed, we headed to the town centre for dinner, where we saw the view of a mountain/hill in the distance. We ate dinner at a new restaurant and headed to the Airbnb. When we got to the AirBnB, my parents went to bed, while my brothers and I had drinks, played games and talked till we went to bed. </p>
<p align="center" >On the fourth day, my parents left early to climb a mountain/hill, while my brothers and I had a late morning. Once we woke up, my brothers started watching a movie (which I didn't want to watch) while I started doing puzzles (which was fun because I like doing puzzles). After a while, my parents returned from their climb, and we had breakfast; once we finished, we headed for the pool and relaxed. We all did underwater races (which I was terrible at), but at least I got the chance to try. We went to the local restaurant/bar to eat and talk about life skills for dinner. After eating, we went back to the Airbnb; we then went for a night swim and went to pack to go back to the UK. Once we finished packing, my brothers and dad watched the movie; while my mum and I finished the puzzle.</p>
<p align="center" >On the last day, we woke up, relaxed, and packed until we left the AirBnB. After we left the place, we went to the airport to get ready for the flight, where we headed back home. </p>
<p align="center" >I had a great holiday travelling with my family. Most of all, I enjoyed chatting with my brothers and parents about many different topics, with life aspirations and just having fun with them. </p>
