<p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to South Africa with my family and family friends and what we did whilst being there.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 10, me and my family went to South Africa, where we met a family of friends. I took my wheelchair because I didn't have my walker then. It made our plans of what we wanted to do and where to go much easier. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to leave for the airport. We then left to board the flight and get onto the plane. After many hours of travelling, we arrived in the morning at the Cape Town Airport in South Africa, where we went to get the bags and took a taxi to the cottage where we were staying. </p>
<p align="center" >The cottage had many rooms. The cottage was a bungalow (where there wasn't an upstairs, the house was just one level); there was a kitchen, living room and two bedrooms. While my family was looking around the house, I decided to make some tea; I tried to open the fridge to get some milk, but when I opened the fridge, I fell, and the fridge fell onto me. The fridge was free-standing, but luckily, there was a wall on the other side, so the fridge didn't harm or crush me. My parents and brothers heard me scream, so they rushed to my support and helped me by getting the fridge off of me and helping me stand up. We relaxed in the cottage for a bit until we left for dinner. After dinner, we talked about what we wanted to do before our family and friends came to meet us. Then, we fell asleep.</p>
<p align="center" >On another day, we did many different activities, which were very enjoyable. We took a taxi to go to an adventure park. In the adventure park, my brothers and dad went quad biking, which looked exciting and fun, until one of my brothers fell off; my mum and I went to help him. After quad biking, we all went ziplining (which was exciting and fun for me to do). We had help from the leader to go up to the ziplining point in quadbikes. Fortunately, we had a great harness and leader to help ensure we were safe. We did the zipline from 50 meters high, which was quite great, but my parents screamed from fright on the way down, whereas my brothers and I stayed silent and had a joyful ride down. Afterwards, we headed out to go to dinner and went to our cottage for a good night's sleep. </p> 
<p align="center" >On one of the days, we left early to go to another adventure course, where there were many tree-top courses with ropes and an outdoor adventure course. They had a useful harness for safety and many helpers to help us finish the course. After this, we got a chance to go white water rafting, but I was told I couldn't go on the heavy rapids, so I went into a van with one of the helpers to get to the safe part of the course (I would have loved the chance to try but unfortunately, I was told it would be too dangerous). In the safe part of the course, I greatly enjoyed the rapids. Throughout the whole course, we all enjoyed ourselves doing this adventure course. After this, we went for dinner and then were met by another family of 3 people, our family friends.</p>
<p align="center" >On the days after, we went on a safari, where we stayed in a cabin/tent with our three family friends, so altogether, there were eight people in the cabin/tent. On these days were saw a lot of animals and had a lot of good desserts with avocado. We normally had many of our lunches near a group of baboons. After a few days passed, we left for the airport to go to Kenya for a gathering of our family and friends. </p>
<p align="center" >This was a great visit; we enjoyed all the adventures throughout the trip, with the chance to talk to my brothers, family, friends and parents.</p>
