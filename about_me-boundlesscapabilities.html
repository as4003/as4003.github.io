    <p align="center" >My name is Avika Shah, and I was born in 2003. My family 
consists of me, my two brothers (one twin and one three years older than 
me), my mother and father.</p>
    <p align="center" >I got diagnosed with the disability of Cerebral Palsy Ataxia (in 2013, when I had 
just turned ten years old), which means I have difficulty with my balance and 
coordination.</p><p>I also have trouble walking and doing small movements with my hands. </p>
    <p align="center" >I have many reasons for creating this website. I thought it would be good for 
different people to know that people with disabilities can do many different 
activities. I hope to inspire people to do many things they think are impossible. 
Mainly, I want to explain and tell people that people with any disability can do 
anything that a non-disabled person can do. </p>
    <p align="center" >I also got inspired to design this website because I know a lot of families want 
to do different things that they think others in their family (with different certain 
abilities) cannot do. Still, people with abilities would like the 
chance/choice to try these activities.</p>â€‹
