    <p align="center" > <strong>When I was seven, I went to Scotland, Edinburgh, with my family and grandparents.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >We went to Scotland because the family wanted to climb Ben Nevis and have a fun family vacation. While there, we stayed in a cottage with the countryside surrounding us. Seven of us were going to Scotland together, so we all had to take a seven-seater car, to allow us to fit.  </p>
<p align="center" >The cottage had three rooms, two downstairs and one upstairs; my grandparents had one room downstairs; me and my mother stayed in the other room downstairs; my father and brothers stayed in the room upstairs. The bedrooms downstairs were with double beds, and the room upstairs had three single beds. The cottage had a living room with very comfortable sofas, a tv and a garden view, a kitchen with all the utensils and equipment, and a few bathrooms for us to all share.</p>
<p align="center" >We drove to Edinburgh, with many rest breaks, to get out of the car and stretch our muscles. Once we arrived at the cottage, we saw a hot tub in the nearby barn, which was handy to cool off and relax in. I had the flu, so I decided not to go into the hot tub while recovering and taking antibiotics. After my brothers and grandparents entered the hot tub, we ate dinner and chatted. Later on, we all watched a quick movie and went to sleep.  </p>
<p align="center" >On the next day, we decided to walk up Ben Arn, a hill in Scotland. We woke up early to get everything ready to climb the hill/mountain. We each took an extra pair of clothes, some suncream, hats, and lots of food and water. We wore a lot of clothing to keep us warm for the climb and left the cottage around 10 am to get to the hill/mountain at a reasonable time. We drove to the mountain, which looked very large. Before we started climbing, we all sat and stretched for a bit. </p>
<p align="center" >After, we started climbing, step by step; both my parents held onto both my hands (I felt their grip was too tight). I put my feet in the correct positions, per my mum's request (so I wouldn't fall over). We walked up the mountain, with many breaks to drink water and have some snacks. On the way down, I was so happy to have completed the challenge that I wanted some ice cream to cool me off and gain more energy. Once we reached the bottom, we got some ice cream and returned to the cottage. Once we got to the cottage, me and my brothers went into the hot tub (I needed help to get into and out of the hot tub), but once I was there, I felt so much better. I stayed in the hot tub till near dinner time; we ate a big meal for dinner and had an early night.</p>
<p align="center" >The next day, my parents and brothers left me with my grandparents to climb Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the UK. While they were gone, my grandparents and I went for a walk, which was good (I held both my grandparents' hands while walking). When we came back, we had lunch, then went into the hot tub. After the hot tub, we returned to the cottage to get dressed and watch tv. Finally, my parents and brothers arrived; they said they all reached the top and had a great time. (I knew it would have been too hard, but luckily I overcame the first obstacle). Once they got in the cottage, we ate dinner and went to sleep.</p>
<p align="center" >The next day, we left the cottage, where we went to see a few more landmarks and drove back to England. While seeing the artefacts, I got tired and fell asleep on the ride home. </p> 
<p align="center" >I had a great holiday visiting Scotland with my family and grandparents. Most of all, I enjoyed spending time with them and being given the chance to climb the mountain.</p>
