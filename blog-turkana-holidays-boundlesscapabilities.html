<p align= "center"> <strong>This is about my trip to Turkana, Kenya, with all my friends and family,
 and about how I managed to cope whilst being there. </strong> </p>
<br>
    <p align= "center">When I was 16, I went to Kenya, Turkana, with my family and friends.</p>
    <p align= "center">Turkana is the largest county in Kenya by land area, the north-westernmost county 
of Kenya. Turkana has many desert regions. Turkana is the name of the people of Turkana. </p>
    <p align= "center">On 23rd July, we went to a location where we were greeted by the team leader, two
 cooks, a driver, and another person to help. The truck was enormous! There were two parts 
of the truck: the driver's position at the front of the truck (which only had two seats, 
the first for the driver and the second for another passenger), and the other part was 
for all of the passengers to enjoy the sceneries, and have a good time with the water tank
 and the food near us. The truck was very high and had tremendous gravitational stability, 
which was useful since it would be going on rough surfaces. It had four steps: two significant steps going up into the truck, then two smaller steps  
into the seating areas. It was challenging to get into the truck since I had to use my 
hands to lift my leg because each step was high. </p>
    <p align= "centre">Once we had assembled all the items, including equipment, bags and most importantly,
 the Kaye walker, the arduous task of packing it all in the truck was underway. There were
 no complaints about my Kaye Walker, which was great :). </p>
<p align= "center">Time is a populated place, city, town, or village. It is a place full of buildings
 where several people live and work. Time is located in the Meru region of Kenya. There
 are many farm and forest areas located near Timau.​</p>
<p align= "center"> The road travelled us from Nairobi, passing Thika, stopping for lunch at Timau. The 
driver effortlessly drove the truck through the mud and the overhanging trees on the 
street. At Timau, there is a small eclectic hotel situated by a river. Right behind the 
accommodation, one would find a small waterfall. The hotel owners appeared to possess an 
admiration for animals.</p>
<p align= "center"> Outside of the Timau hotel, it was very wheelchair accessible, which meant I could take
 out my Kaye walker to use it for walking and moving around, which I was very grateful for
 so that I could stretch my legs and gain a little bit of independence. However, I 
couldn't use the walker to see the waterfall because the waterfall surroundings
 were very rough and rigid, so I had to hold two people's hands to get to look
 at the waterfall.</p>
<p align= "center">For lunch, we enjoyed sandwiches with a choice of many sandwich fillings, which were set
 by the two chefs (with the help of the others). In contrast, the rest of us enjoyed the 
scenery and the waterfall. We left within an hour. </p>
<p align= "center">Nanyuki is a town in central Kenya. It is a gateway to Mount Kenya and the wildness
 within the Mount Kenya National Park. </p>
<p align= "center">After an hour of driving, we reached Nanyuki, stopping for any 
last-minute shopping before continuing to Turkana. One juice bar had a fantastic array of 
Different freshly squeezed fruit juices, which were delicious. </p>
<p align= "center">Sabie Camp is an eco campsite located near three national reserves and Mount Ololokwe.</p>
<p align= "center">En route to Sabache Camp and Mt Ololokwe, we passed the Elephant Corridor. By the luck 
of the draw, we saw elephants and giraffes; unfortunately, we couldn't stop to get a better
 look at them. The Elephant Corridor is an area of land linking different national parks
 to provide a safe passage for elephants to walk and cross the road in search of food
 and water. We also passed an interesting rock formation, emphasized by its Tom and Jerry
 nickname – the 'Cat and Mouse' formation. </p>
<p align="center">Our destination at Sabache Camp took over eight hours; the journey was rough. We had 
five stops to use different facilities, for which we were grateful. </p>
 <p align= "center">On every trip in the truck, we, the youngsters, chose to sit at the back, and the 
adults were relegated to the front (not without any opposition). I sat on the seats at the
 far back, making it easier to get up and out of the truck at the stops. </p>
<p align= "center">We stayed at the Sabache Camp for two nights. When we got to the Sabache Camp, everyone
 was exhausted. The tents were all removed from the truck. Everyone had the 'pleasure' of
 setting their tents up (before nightfall). I tried to help with putting up the tents. 
Still, before we started, I got told to sit on the side and wait there for everyone else 
to finish, which did make me feel a bit upset and useless while we were there; fortunately,
 I tried to keep myself occupied (by listening to my music) and didn't let this put me in 
a bad mood. Although I would have liked to try to help. </p>
​<p align= "center">Eventually, all the tents had to be set up with help from the young adult boys since nobody
 else could do it.</p>
<p align="center">There were different sleeping arrangements; people slept with friends or family members. 
We ate dinner at eight o'clock in the evening. Dinner on the first night was vegetable
 stew with rice and roast vegetables. We had a campfire during and after dinner, which was
 very comforting. We all discussed a range of topics and played card games. We all fell 
asleep at about eleven o'clock because it had been a long journey on the truck. </p>
<p align= "center"> The next day, most people left after breakfast at eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p align= "center">They packed their bags, including water, sun cream, sun cap, and sunglasses
 , and left the Sabache Camp to climb Mt Ololokwe. It took them eight hours to climb the 
whole mountain.</p> 
<p align= "center">I was told I couldn't climb the mountain. I did know that the leader
 was right, but I still would have liked the chance to try to climb the hill and to get
 stronger by climbing the mountain.</p>
<p align= "center">The team found something else for the people who weren't climbing the mountain 
(including me) to do: go on for a medicine plant walk. We learned about helping cure diseases
 by using plants for diseases like yellow fever and diarrhoea. Our guides (the Samburu men
 in their attire) pointed out the birds, the history, and the value of the land. (It was 
very informative and beautiful).</p>
<p align= "center">For lunch, the people who climbed the mountain ate sandwiches. The people who stayed at
 the camp for the medicine walk ate vegetable stew with rice, leftover from the previous 
night. The people climbing the mountain got back at four o'clock in the afternoon. Once 
the others returned from climbing the mountain, we were taught how to put up and take down 
our tents.</p>
<p align= "center">When they returned to the campsite, we stayed at Sabache Camp for one more night after 
the mountain climbing. We ate dinner around six o'clock and ate pizza 
and chips with roast vegetables – freshly made daily by the chef. The pizza was good. 
Before and after dinner, we all played some football (I got a chance to kick the ball 
despite being in the walker), which was fun. We had a campfire and fell asleep at different
 times.</p>
<p align= "center">On 25th July, we had our wake-up call at 5.30 am. As we all trickled out of our tents,
 the sun rose. Breakfast was equally satisfying as the dinner from the previous night: 
French toast, baked beans, toast, cereals, eggs and fruit. The team leader had recommended 
that an early start to the next part of the journey be beneficial as we had planned to go 
onto Rockslides in the Ngurunit. After a session of packing and loading the luggage and 
tents into the truck, we left for Ngurunit. Naturally, while the packing was ongoing, most
 of us played cricket. Getting all the luggage and the walker into the 
truck was a struggle, but fortunately, they managed. On the drive, we saw a lot of male ostriches and goats
 and a lot of towns on the road. </p>
<p align= "center">We all had a stop at the Marsabit County welcome sign and saw it on the way there. When
 we were there, we took many photos of our whole group and stayed there for about one hour.</p> 
<p align= "center">​After that, we stopped off at a petrol station to get water to drink, but it was hard work
 to get the water into the truck.</p>
<p align= "center">Once back on the road, the tarmac part ended, and the journey became bumpier.
 At one point not far from Ngurunit, the truck's wheel got stuck in the sand.</p>
<p align= "center">The deeper the truck sank, the more we tried to return to the functional 'road'. We were
 there on the sand for about 4 hours because they were trying different things, such as 
putting rocks under the tyre and using sandblasters. Some of us went outside to play 
cricket, whilst some (including me) stayed in the truck while trying to get out of the 
sand.</p>
<p align= "center">When we got back on the road, it took us about one hour to get to the campsite. Ngurunit
 had a limited water supply, but the campsite manager had kept water for us to shower. This
 was a beautiful campsite. The truck was unloaded, and the tents were pitched in no time. 
We were becoming rather proficient. We then made a campfire and talked while eating dinner.</p>
<p align= "centre">The following day, the team leader didn't have to wake us up, as again, we were 
well-practised in the art of rising around 5.30 am. Once we were done with breakfast and 
packed, we walked together on the sand to see different plants and flowers. Some 
returned early to the truck to wait for the others; I was the first to return because the 
path was too rough for me. (My wheels nearly got stuck in the sand.) :) </p>
<p align= "center">This also gave some time for the truck to be loaded again.</p>
<p align= "center">We left the Lasamu campsite, Ngurunit, to visit the Malabo resort in Loiyangalani. The 
landscape changed drastically from shrubbery and mountains to rocks and dry land. As we 
continued, we saw the famous Jade Lake, Lake Turkana. Soon after, we came across a 
large village with a school nearby. This was our stop for the donations. Our group formed 
an 'orderly' conveyor belt system to arrange the supplies in bags. I got to help fill the 
bags with different collections, which was very enjoyable. Seeing the
 children receive their school supplies with enthusiasm and appreciation was heart-warming. We reached 
the campsite at around four o'clock in the afternoon. We stayed there for two nights.</p>
<p align= "center">We set up all our tents and unpacked our bags and tents from the truck when we arrived.
 It was sweltering hot. We were not sure how we were going to cope in the heat. The bar 
nearby had the best cold drinks, which was a relief. This was where we all gathered as it 
was excellent, with cold drinks and a constant supply of snacks. This is also where we 
played some card games. The bar was up many stairs, which was not ideal, but I managed. 
Whilst holding two other people's hands to get up the stairs. We had a campfire and then ate dinner. Some of our group helped with the dinner.</p> 
<p align= "center">It was still too hot to sleep, but we were exhausted.</p>
<p align= "center"> We visited El Molo Village the following day. We went to make donations at a 
local school. We donated school supplies again to about 300 children in the school. After 
we had given them the donations, all the children in the school sang a song for us and gave us
 some presents. We all liked helping different children with their education. It also 
brought home how we have to appreciate what we have.</p>
<p align= "center">After donating to a school, some visited the Desert Museum. Some others
 went boating to the nearby island. We all saw an enormous crocodile. It was sweltering.</p>
<p align= "center">Later, we changed into our swimming costumes and went swimming in Lake Turkana. It was 
tough to get to the lake because there were many pebbles around, so I walked with two 
other people in the group. We all had a perfect time and played many games in the lake. 
We stayed on the lake for about two hours. It was gratifying. Many people felt that the 
water was alkaline.</p>
<p align= "center">Once we had overstayed in the lake, we returned to the campsite, feeling more relaxed 
and refreshed. We went to the bar upstairs to have sodas and other 
drinks as soon as we showered. Dinner was ready by the time we had all refreshed and played cards.</p>
<p align= "center">We had dinner around the campfire, talked about different things, and played games. 
We all then slept at other times. It had been a tiring day. </p>
<p align= "center">On 28th July, we played some cricket in the morning while the helpers gathered their 
equipment. That was a good round of cricket where everyone (even me) got a chance to bat. 
We left to return to the Lasamu campsite, Ngurunit. Many dogs were around all campsites, 
but they were not aggressive (they were very friendly).</p>
<p align="center">On 29th July, we left Ngurunit for Marsabit. This was interesting as Marsabit has both 
rainforest and dry vegetation in the same place, almost separated by the road in the 
middle. We reached there in good time. Once again, the landscapes changed.</p>
<p align= "center">We also went to see a water hole where we saw some water buffalos and other animals; at
 this stop, we ate lunch and then went back on the truck to the AIC Campsite. This 
campsite was set up well, especially the campfire. The facilities and the ground were 
perfect for us. We had a family of baboons visit us the following day as they were 
crossing through the forest. Luckily for us, they kept their distance.</p>
<p align= "center">Dinner was again made with the assistance of some of our group. We had khichdi, which 
was well received.</p>
<p align= "center">Our next day took us to Samburu National Park. The journey took longer, with many stops 
to look at ostriches and gazelles and visit dunes.</p>
<p align= "center">Once we reached the campsite in the sweltering heat, we set up camp and reached out for
 the cold drinks in the shaded bar. The campsite was located on the banks of the Ewaso 
Nyiro River.</p>
<p align= "center">Lunch was again provided quickly and with a selection of Khichi, stir-fry, spaghetti and 
sauce. It was very delicious!</p>
<p align= "center">During this time, the team leader arranged the drives for the National Park for the 
evening. We went to see the animals in the Samburu National Park. There were many animals, 
which included monkeys, lions, giraffes, zebras, and elephants, which was fascinating. 
We had a long truck drive. We all took three trucks separately. There was five-nine 
people in each truck. Altogether, 18 people went on tour of the national park. Then, we had 
dinner around a fire. We then went to sleep at different times in our tents.</p>
<p align= "center">On 31st July, at Samburu, we had breakfast and looked at the sunrise. 
We had to go down a rocky path to see the sunrise, which was quite tricky for me, so I 
went without my walker but with two other people holding my hands. We took a lot of photos 
there while looking at the sunrise. The sunrise looked beautiful. Afterwards, we played 
cricket with all our friends. We each got a chance to ball, bat, and field. We relaxed 
and enjoyed the scenery over there.</p> ​ 
<p align= "center"> We started going to Nairobi on the truck. The truck drive took about seven hours. 
We got to Nairobi at about six o'clock in the afternoon. We made some stops on the way. 
One of the stops we took was where the equator line was, and one was at a restaurant/cafe 
where we ate.</p>
<p align= "center">This was my whole trip to Turkana and back to Nairobi; it was a great trip where 
everyone accommodated me and my needs. </p>
