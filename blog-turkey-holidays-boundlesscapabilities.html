<p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Turkey with my family for three days.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 12, me and my family went to Turkey. I took my wheelchair because I didn't use my walker often. It made our plans of what we wanted to do and where to go much easier. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to leave for the airport. At the airport, we unloaded our bags, and then we left the car to go to the check-in, where we were told to go into the fast lane for the security check. We then waited to board the flight. After a few hours, we got onto the plane. We arrived at the Turkey Airport in over 3 hours, where we got the bags and took a taxi to the hotel</p>
<p align="center" >We spent three days in Turkey, getting a room in a nice hotel; we got two rooms, one for my brothers and one for my parents and me. We arrived in the morning and had enough time to see the city and shop. We went to many places and then to a cafe for ice cream. After, we went to the market, where I stayed in the wheelchair, and we went to buy many different things.</p>
<p align="center" >On the next day, we woke up early to get ready for the day bus tour, where we walked to a bus stop to catch the bus to go on the day tour. We made many stops to go shopping, buy spices and herbs with different kinds of things, go to a museum with the theatre and see many artefacts. We also got the chance to see a lot of churches and cathedrals, to develop a historical understanding. Once we had finished the bus tour, we went to a restaurant, near the sea, for dinner, but we only found a few vegetarian options for my parents. </p> 
<p align="center" >The day after, we left early to cruise to see the three capital cities and all the artefacts. The cruise was all day and took us all around the cities. We had great enjoyment during the day and cruise; we all sat in different places and moved around a lot while getting the chance to see everything. We got a chance to take many photos together of ourselves. That night, we went to dinner and packed up. Once we had packed, we went to the airport and headed back home. </p>
<p align="center" >This was a great visit, and we enjoyed the whole trip with the chance to talk to my brother and parents.</p>
