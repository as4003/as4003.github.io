    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Wales to climb Snowdonia with my dad, brother, cousins, aunt and uncle, and grandparents.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 19, we went to Wales for one night to climb the mountain. Snowdonia is the highest mountain in Wales; its elevation is over a thousand metres. For the night, we stayed at a hotel/motel-type place with many rooms, a gym and a living area to eat breakfast in. The hotel was near the road, which was easy to get to. </p>
 <p align="center" >After we left home, we headed to Milton Keynes to pick up my aunt, uncle and cousin. We reached around noon, loaded the other car, changed the number of people in each car, and headed to the hotel/motel. We had to park the cars on the streets after we entered the hotel, but my walker couldn't fit in through the corridor, so we had to keep it outside. I used alternative door, which was very difficult to open and go use the walker.</p>
<p align="center" >Once we unpacked and rested in our rooms, my brother and cousin went to the gym and spent some time there till the others arrived. We then left the hotel to see sea views and eat ice cream. After the walk, we returned to the hotel to drive to a pub/restaurant for dinner. It was a very fulfilling dinner; we then went back to the hotel to go to bed and sleep.</p>
<p align="center" > The next day, we woke up early to get everything ready to climb the mountain. We each took an extra pair of clothes, some suncream, hats, and lots of food and water. We wore a lot of clothing to keep us warm for the climb. We ate breakfast from the hotel's cafeteria, talked for a bit, and relaxed while the others were loading the cars. We left the hotel for a reasonable time to get to the mountain. We drove to the mountain, where we got everything ready and took the walking sticks out of the car. Before we started climbing, we all sat and stretched for a bit. </p>
<p align="center" >Once we had all stretched, we started climbing, step by step; I held onto my dad's hand and the walking stick while everyone went to the top at a faster speed (but luckily, they all had another person with them). I tried to put my feet in the correct positions, but sometimes I did fall over (but I got up and continued). Every time I needed to stop, for the reason of being tired or falling, I had a chance to take a rest break. I only had enough energy to reach the halfway point of the mountain. On the way down, I was so happy to have completed halfway up; I put on some of my music to make my way down to relax a bit. Once we reached the bottom, we returned to the car to chill out and eat food. </p>
<p align="center" >After getting into the car, we went to Birmingham for Mcdonalds and then went back to Milton Keynes to pick up the other car. We then left to go back home and relax.</p> 
<p align="center" >I had a great holiday visiting Wales with my family. Most of all, I enjoyed spending time with them and being given the chance to climb the mountain. I had many obstacles on the way, where I got very tired of the climb, and towards the end, my legs fell asleep.</p>
