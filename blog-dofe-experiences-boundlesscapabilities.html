<p align="center" > <strong>This is about how I did my DOFE.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >The truth is that I started this because of my brothers, and I wanted to be like them, but then I started to do it for myself and to build my skills. I also did this because my secondary school was advertising it, and some of my friends were doing DOFE, too; this was to grow my confidence and independence, with the chance to gain more friendships</p>
<p align="center" >I started my Bronze awards with my secondary school. In Bronze, 3/6 Months for Volunteering, 3/6 Months for Physical and 3/6 Months for Skills(where one for 6 Months and two for 3 Months), with 2 days 1 night for the Expedition.</p> 
<p align="center" >I spent 3 Months doing my Volunteering Section of the Bronze Award, where I worked as a Library Assistant to help my community. This was to gain my independence </p>
<p align="center" >I spent 3 Months doing my Physical Section of the Bronze Award, where I played Boccia with a group of other people, which helped me gain my confidence </p>
<p align="center" >I spent 6 Months doing my Skills Section of the Bronze Award, where I learnt a language at home with a tutor. This was to improve my language skills in Spanish while taking many notes and learning how to read books in Spanish</p>
<p align="center" >For the Expedition part of the Bronze programme, I asked my school, but they wouldn't take me, and they didn't give me a trial; therefore, I felt a bit bad (but I did want to prove to everyone, that I could do it). My parents and I spent a lot of time planning. Eventually, we went with someone we knew, but DOFE said I needed to go with someone who was a DOFE Leader. I used a tricycle in the first Expedition, and we tried to call it a Practice Expedition. We did a lot of research for a disability-friendly place that does DOFE Expeditions. Finally, we found a place in Gloucestershire, where I did my Expedition in 2019 after my GCSEs. We were split into three groups of ages and walked in the Forest of Dean to finish the DOFE Expedition. I did this Expedition while walking with my Walking Frame, but I did use my wheelchair most of the time when I was tired, where I met a lot of great friends, which improved my confidence, independence, motivation and teamwork skills. </p>
<p align="center" >Once I finished the Volunteering, Physical and Skills parts of the Bronze DOFE Programme, I started my Silver DOFE Programme while my parents were looking for different ways for me to do my Bronze Expedition. I wanted to start my Silver for many reasons; I wanted to achieve more out of doing my DOFE Programme.</p>
<p align="center" >I did the Silver DOFE Programme with the Herts County Council, which was 3/6 Months for Volunteering, 3/6 Months for Physical and 3/6 Months for Skills, where two were for 6 Months, and one was for 3 Months. The Expedition would last for 3 days and 2 nights.
<p align="center" >I spent 6 Months in my Volunteering Section of Silver DOFE; I worked as an online tutor to help a student with mathematics, which helped me gain confidence. For this, I used the laptop and computer to stay online. </p>
<p align="center" >I spent 6 Months in the Physical Section, where I went to the Gym each week to gain strength while using the Cycling machine, rowing machine, weights, and other equipment</p>
<p align="center" >I spent 3 Months in the Skills Section of this Programme, where I did blogging, with the key to learning and collecting information. This was to improve my writing skills and confidence, to take many notes to start to blog</p>
<p align="center" >I spent a lot of time planning for the Silver Expedition and did it in the same place as my Bronze DOFE Expedition. After my GCSEs, I did my Expedition in 2019 with my Bronze DOFE Expedition, where I got to walk in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire. I walked with my Walking Frame but used my wheelchair when I was tired, where I was fortunate to meet a lot of great people and helpers who became friends</li>
<p align="center" >When my Silver Expedition ended, I started doing my Gold DOFE Programme to gain the chance to finish the whole DOFE Programme and get an addition of skills.</p>
<p align="center" >In the middle of my Gold DOFE Programme, I got interviewed on Sky News after the passing of Prince Phillip, where they asked many questions about this adventure and how it has helped me. It felt great to be interviewed about DofE; it was like a dream to talk about my experiences and adventures with people worldwide. I hoped the journey would inspire people to hear it on the news. I felt nervous and excited simultaneously, needing to find the right words. </p>
<p align="center" >I did my Gold DOFE Programme with the Herts County Council, where there are 6/12 Months for Volunteering, 6/12 Months for Physical and 6/12 Months for Skills, where there are two for 12 Months and one for 6 Months, with 4 days and 3 nights for the Expedition and a Residential section, which is for 5 days and 4 nights. </p>
<p align="center" >I spent 12 Months in the Volunteering part of the program, where I worked to help my community by helping elderly people in their houses, which helped me gain independence and communication skills.</p>
<p align="center" >I spent 6 Months in the Physical section, where I went to the Gym and swam each week to gain more strength while using different types of equipment.</p>
<p align="center" >I spent 12 Months doing my Skills, where I learnt cooking with a tutor and many different recipes, which helped improve my cooking skills. After each lesson, I got to take the recipes to cook with at home.</p>
<p align="center" >Normally, the Expedition would be for 4 days and 3 nights. I did this right after the Residential Section, so I had to quickly wash everything before the Expedition and head out for this. I spent a lot of time preparing for this adventure. Before starting university, I did this Expedition in the same place as my Bronze and Silver Expedition in 2021. For this, I was able to walk longer with the Kaye Walker in the Forest of Dean than the Bronze and Silver Expedition, but I used my wheelchair when I was tired, very rarely. This was also where I met a lot of great people who became friends</p>
<p align="center" >At the beginning of August, I spent 5 days and 4 nights in my Residential before my Expedition. I did a lot of research to find where I could do my Residential and came across a Taste of Teaching programme while using nature and the environment to teach. This activity is to build education through the environment and nature.</p>
<p align="center" >These adventures all improved a lot of skills, such as Confidence, Independence, Motivation, Teamwork Skills, Organisation, Navigation, Communication Skills, Cooking Skills, Writing Skills and Language Skills.</p>
<p align="center" >For the Ceremony and Celebration of DOFE, I went with my dad and cousin since my cousin also got the award and went to the ceremony together, which was great to celebrate our different experiences of the award in a union. Before this, I signed up to go to the DofE Celebration. After a year, I got a letter to ask if I wanted to come to Buckingham Palace and also get the certificate and a brooch</p>
