    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to France when I went to Lourdes for a week with some friends and a couple of teachers. This is about how I managed without my family. </strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 15, I was chosen by a teacher to go to Lourdes, France, with a few of my friends and a group. It took a lot of preparation and meetings to make this happen.</p>
<p align="center" >​We went as a part of the HCPT Pilgrimage, a pilgrimage for disadvantaged or disabled young people. HCPT is a charity that supports pilgrimages to Lourdes, France.</p>
​<p align="center" >We had a lot of small meetings with the teachers and a few of the students within the group. The first meeting was with some students in the school, our parents and two of the R.S. (Religious Studies) teachers within the first meeting, which were in one of the R.S. classes on the ground level. In this meeting, they informed us about the whole programme, like
what it was about, and how it would work. The second meeting was about the bake sale we would have, before the Easter holidays/End of Term, to be able to pay for other one's trips to go on the pilgrimage. Our third meeting was only with the students from the school and the two teachers, without any of our parents, who told us about how the group and HCPT programme would be. In the third meeting, we learnt who was going on the trip; there were going to be four supportive people from Year 12 in school, two people from Year 9 in the school, two people from Year 10 in the school (including me) and six people from another group. The fourth meeting had only the students in the school and within the HCPT group for everyone to get to know each other, make more friends with the others in the group, and talk about the bake and who's making what for sale. The fifth meeting was the last meeting that we had in a nearby church, right before the April/Easter holidays, which was about what times we had to meet and where we had to meet. We were also told what to bring and what to bring to the pilgrimage with us. We all also got our hoddies for the group and trip. </p>
​<p align="center" >We left early to get to the coach. I was a bit scared to go without my family there. My parents came to drop me off at my school, where the coach was leaving. After I got dropped off, we all got into the coach to sit to go to the airport. I sat near the front of the coach, with all my friends sitting around me. On the way to the airport, I sat next to my friend who was in my year, and we talked and listened to music. It took us one hour to get from the drop point to the airport. Once we got to the airport, the coach parked outside the area. While they unloaded the coach, a teacher helped get my Walker ready. Although the Walker fell over as I tried to lean on my Walker (at 4 am, when it was very dark), I fell onto my bottom and funnily laughed (but everyone was a bit frightened about me losing). Once we got into the airport, we went to the check-in counter to get our boarding passes. Then, we dropped off our luggage at the baggage claim. We later went to the security check/screening and left to go to the boarding of the flight to be able to board the flight and go to France with everyone else. I slept throughout the entire flight; I was so tired because I had only slept for one hour the last night. </p>
​<p align="center" >We reached the airport in France in the morning. Then, we left the airport to go to the hotel to unpack (or, in my case, drop off my luggage in the room) with my friend, who I would be sharing my room. After we dropped off our bags, we all gathered in the lounging area of the hotel, where we discussed the week. We were then given two booklets covering the information of the trip, the Prayer Book and a Journal Book full of information about this journey. In the books, there was information about each of the days of the pilgrimage.</p> 
<p align="center" >After this, we left the hotel to walk around outside of the hotel. I went in a wheelchair, and one of my friends, with the helpers, told me to push us. There were a lot of stairs to get to the town centre, where we relaxed and went to a cafe. After some time, we left to return to the hotel, where we gathered for dinner. Once we finished dinner, they told us what we would be doing the next day. Soon after, we were told to go to bed and rest till tomorrow.</p>
<p align="center">On the second day, we ate breakfast (they had many different jams, which I loved), and we gathered in the lounge area of the hotel. The group's instructors told us the reason for coming to Lourdes and about Saint Bernadette. St Bernadette is a French nun who lived in the 1800s and had visions of the Virgin Mary in the Massabielle Grotto, leading to the founding of the shrine of Lourdes. </p>
<p align="center">We did different types of activities on each day, mostly sightseeing the different places memorable to St Bernadette. We visited the Grotto and the Baths and went to the Torchlight Processions, with the old house of Saint Bernadette and the Trust Mass. The Grotto is a small cave where the Virgin Mary appeared to Bernadette, where we came to light a candle and prayed. There is a statue of the Virgin Mary above the cave, where everyone was reminded of Saint Bernadette.</p>
<p align="center">When visiting the Baths, we saw where the Virgin Mary asked Bernadette to dig into the earth and drink and wash in the water. The Baths are about how Bernadette knelt and scraped at the dry earth; soon, a small trickle of water was found, which became much stronger. The water from the spring is still flowing, so pilgrims can drink and wash in the Holy Water from the spring. The Holy Water is said to be very religious and symbiotic. </p>
<p align="center">When we went to the Torchlight Procession, we visited to see all the lights and decorations, with the whole Church lit up with lots of colourful lights and statues. The Torchlight Procession happens because, originally, Mary asked Bernadette to invite people to come in the procession, while every evening, as darkness falls, the pilgrims assemble with lit candles to be in the procession in honour of the Virgin Mary. In this, the Rosary is recited in many languages, with the remainder of the Church being worldwide, which also represents a mystery and event in the life of Jesus, where we sing hymns. The procession occurs in the square, with various people participating.</p>
<p align="center">When going to the old house of Saint Bernadette, we got to see where St Bernadette grew up and where she lived when visited by the Virgin Mary. We could see where St Bernadette slept when she was young and where she went after visiting Virgin Mary. A gift shop was nearby to get souvenirs related to St Bernadette. </p>
<p align="center">On Thursday morning, the Trust Mass began, where we gathered to enjoy all the highlights from the pilgrimage. In the Trust Mass, we got to see the whole number of people sharing the pilgrimage with us. We got to see a joyful celebration of the Mass, where we sang many hymns and songs to celebrate the St Bernadette visitation by the Virgin Mary.​</p>
<p align="center">We carried out various activities, including meetings with all the participants of the group gathering to pray and read the individual prayers and hymns. We also met up to do different things each night, like a talent show night. We got the chance to go to see the icy mountain and the surroundings of the area, where we also got a chance to go for a ride on a horse or donkey (I went for a ride on the donkey), while everyone else went to a cafe for food and drinks.</p>
<p align="center">This was a fascinating adventure and experience to go on a holiday with everyone on the pilgrimage, who became one of our great friends.</p>
