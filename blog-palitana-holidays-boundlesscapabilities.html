<p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to go to India with my grandmother and family whilst 
climbing the Palitana and about how I was able to climb it with my ability. </strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 11, I went to India with my grandmother and family. I wasn't diagnosed with one disability, so I didn't have a walker/wheelchair.</p>
<p align="center" >We first visited Mumbai when visiting India. Still, only me, my grandmother, my mother, and my twin brother because our school had finished earlier, so my older brother and dad came a week later. We went to the Mumbai airport from a London airport; we then went to a hotel to stay the night in Mumbai.</p> 
<p align="center" >After getting to the hotel and setting down our luggage, we ate dinner at a nearby restaurant the hotel. Finding a taxi and hotel was easy since we did not have a walker or wheelchair. The next day, we quickly got a taxi to Bhuj, but while we were there, my twin brother and I got sick because we had food poisoning from the restaurant the night before.</p>
<p align="center" >We arrived in Bhuj; we stayed at my grandmother's friend's house; this was comforting since it wasn't another hotel. On the first night, my brother and I were ill all day. The day after, I needed help eating. I sat outside with my mum to get more fresh air, and my mum fed me pasta to gain more energy. Although my stomach felt bad, I felt better than the night before.</p>
<p align="center" >That night, we all went to a priest, asking for help with my disability. Eventually, I grew stronger and became even more healthy; they asked me and everyone else to pray and then asked me to eat something to make me much more substantial and healthier.</p>
<p align="center" >I visited a temple with my grandmother and mother the next day. At the same time, my brother stayed with my grandmother's friend. We met another priest to talk about my disability again. The temple's decorations looked beautiful. The priest was wearing a pretty long shirt with many different jewels. We got told by the priest to eat no butter or oil for three months to gain strength and try to get rid of my disability (it did not work, but it did make me healthier).</p>
<p align="center" >After this, we all said goodbye to my grandmother's friend and got a taxi to Gujarat to meet my father and eldest brother.</p>
<p align="center" >After leaving Bhuj, we met my father and eldest brother in Gujarat to climb the Palitana the next day with my family and grandmother.</p>
<p align="center" >The Palitana is located in Gujarat, India, where the religion of Jainism originated. There are about 863 temples in the Palitana and more than 3750 stone steps to see all the temples at the top of the Palitana. The Palitana is around 1978 feet high to reach up to the top.</p>
<p align="center" >On the 14th of December, the family climbed the whole of the Palitana. I climbed up the Palitana with two people on each side to hold my hands and help me rise and walk up the steps of the Palitana. We all climbed the Palitana with a lot of water, and the reminder was that I could be carried up the Palitana by Dholi carriers if I wanted or was tired. The Dholi carriers were at every rest point and ranged from different places whenever I tried to take a breather or get some water.</p>
<p align="center" >Although fortunately, I had managed to climb up the Palitana.</p>
<p align="center" >I was too tired to return to the Palitana, so my parents asked the Dholi carriers to take me back down. The Dholi looked very uncomfortable but was surprisingly comfortable. Still, it would have been comfortable after walking up. :)</p>
<p align="center" >Once we had all reached the steps of the Palitana, we all ate some mango and ice cream at a nearby shop near the Palitana to cool down and gain our energy back because we were all exhausted. </p>
<p align="center" >After going to Gujarat, we left for a week to go to a hotel in Goa. When going to Goa, we went to a great hotel with a big pool area, where we all relaxed for some time after the long journey up and down the Palitana.</p>
