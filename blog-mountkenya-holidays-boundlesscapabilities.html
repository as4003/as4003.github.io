  <p align="center" > <strong>Kenya, with all my friends and family. My family and friends went up Mount Kenya, while I went to the Sweet Waters Serene Camp with some friends.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align= "center">When I was 12, I went to Kenya with my family and friends.</p>
  <p align= "center">Every couple of years, my family gets together with friends for a group holiday. Two years ago, we went to Kenya. This year, we decided to meet in Nairobi and Malindi, Kenya. Four families travelled from the United Kingdom and another from Kenya. We flew from Heathrow Airport. The flight was about eight hours long.</p>
  <p align= "center">It was a surprisingly comfortable flight with good food and good movies & games on each of the screens. Although, the flight was a bit hard for me to walk to the plane with my walker and walking speed. It was also tough for me to get the wheelchair from the airport because it came to us very slowly by all the people working there.</p>
  <p align= "center">The whole holiday started with my family and me staying at my parent's friend's house for about three days. After three days, my family and friends (unfortunately not me) met and went to climb Mount Kenya in the early morning.</p>
  <p align= "center">I did want to climb Mount Kenya with my family and friends. I wanted to climb the mountain to achieve my dreams of being able to climb at least some of the mountain. Although the mountain was high, I still did want to try and be included in the group who were climbing the mountain. Every time they told me about the mountain over the phone, I felt upset and left out that I wasn't there to enjoy it with them. I also felt this way to prove I could climb the mountain.</p>
  <p align= "center">They spent eight days climbing the mountain. Those who didn't go up Mount Kenya went to a wildlife park called Sweet Waters Serene Camp (including me). </p>
  <p align= "center">The Sweet Waters Park was good (although I didn't go climbing Mount Kenya); we went with six people (including me). The wildlife park had a lot of different animals. The Camp had amazing huts/rooms and a huge dining hall. We got two huts/rooms for the six of us. We mostly stayed in our huts/rooms and went for 1 Day game drive where we saw a lot of different animals. I stayed with 2 of the adults, and the two little kids aged 6 stayed with one of the young adults. The Camp gave us cake and cups of tea before we went to the Day game drive.</p>
  <p align= "center"> There was a big buffet with different foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The breakfast buffet had a lot of fruits, eggs, toast, cereals and vegetarian breakfast foods. The Lunch and Dinner buffet had many of the same foods like pasta, eggs, fruits and salads.</p>
  <p align= "center">Although I didn't get the chance to climb Mount Kenya, I had a lot of fun at the Sweet Waters Serene Camp and my parent's friend's house. </p>
  <p align= "center">We spent three days there, and then I stayed with my parent's friend's while waiting for the others to arrive from the Mount Kenya climb. On the night the others returned from Mount Kenya, they went to the slushy shop near the place we were staying (without me). Although I was very hurt by that, I felt more upset being unable to climb the mountain.</p>
  <p align= "center">Honestly, I was a bit sad for one main reason: I knew I could have at least done until the base camp. Still, I could have been given the chance to decide what I could do and given the chance to prove to myself that I could have done this if given the choice to do this. Nevertheless, I did have a good time.</p>
  <p align= "center">Once they returned to my parent's friend's house, we all talked about different topics and fell asleep in our resting areas to get ready to go to Malindi the next day.</p>
  <p align= "center">On the morning of the next day, we all went to the airport to get the flight to Milindi. At the airport, we met a few people who had gone to Mount Kenya with the others; I also met a few new people. We went to the Neptune Hotel in Malindi.</p>
  <p align= "center">After the climb of Mount Kenya, I was sad, but I tried not to show it for the next part of the holiday, so in Milindi, I tried to do many different activities and have more fun, not to feel more left out. I even tried to play snooker to enjoy myself. However, when they started talking about Mount Kenya, I had many unhappy thoughts about being left alone, and I felt like I was about to cry. I tried not to feel worse, so I just giggled with everybody else.</p>
  <p align= "center">We had some exciting adventures on holiday. On the 4th day, one of the adults came to us and told us about a sky diving centre where most of the kids went skydiving with a few of the adults. I would have wanted to do it because it would have been another enjoyable experience, but they told me I was too short to wear the harness. I was a bit sad and thought I couldn't do anything, but I knew it wasn't true and wouldn't be. </p>
  <p align= "center">As well as missing the climb up Mount Kenya, I also felt upset about this adventure I missed. Besides that, we spent most of our time playing water polo in the swimming pool, sitting and just talking, or at the beach.</p>
  <p align= "center">The whole holiday was enjoyable, with a lot of happiness and unhappiness with everything that had happened, but I didn't let this stop me from accomplishing other achievements. Still, there were also some emotions, full of my love for the whole family.</p>
