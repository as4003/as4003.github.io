   <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Athens and Crete in Greece, with all my friends and
 family, and about how I kept up with everyone else with me. </strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 14, I went to Greece with my family and friends.</p>
<p align="center" >Every couple of years, my family gets together with friends for a group holiday. Two years ago, we went to Kenya. This year, we decided to meet on the island of Crete in Greece. Four families travelled from the United Kingdom, and another four families travelled from Kenya.</p>
<p align="center" >We flew from Heathrow Airport on the 12th of August in the afternoon with British Airways airline. The flight was about four hours long. It was a surprisingly comfortable flight with good food. Still, getting onto the aeroplane with the walker was hard, so we used a wheelchair (which was hard to get from the airport before the flight) to get to the plane.</p>
<p align="center" >On the day we got there, we stayed in Athens for four days before going to Crete to meet our family friends. Our family landed in Athens at around six o'clock in the afternoon. We got to the Hilton hotel at around half-past seven in the evening.</p>
<p align="center" >The Hilton Hotel was good for accessibility and had many lifts to get to the different rooms in the hotel, which had a lot of space inside.</p>
<p align="center" >The Hilton Hotel is in the centre of Athens. It is close to the Evangelismos Metro Station and Syntagma Square. After landing, we took a taxi, which took a long time since we had to find a taxi to fit us all in, with all the luggage and the walker, to go to the hotel. After this, we checked in to the hotel, which took about 2 hours to go to the rooms to unpack. We had booked two rooms in the Hilton Hotel. When we had finished, we walked to a restaurant.</p>
<p align="center" >We had a good dinner in a local restaurant near the hotel, Syntagma Square, where we ate dinner. The restaurant had little space for my walker to be near me. Although, it was the only open place then and had a great menu that everyone in the family liked. We ordered some peanut butter sandwiches, pitta and hummus, and Greek salad when we reached the restaurant.</p>
<p align="center" >While eating, our family met another family, our friends. Four family friends met us in this restaurant. So there were five teenagers, four boys and one girl (who was me) and two couples. The family came from Kenya to meet us. After we had all eaten, we walked back to the same hotel, where we went back to our rooms and went to sleep.</p>
<p align="center" >On the second day in Athens, we all woke up early and had breakfast around eight o'clock. We had breakfast together with our family and our family friends. We all had a great breakfast; we got breakfast from the Hilton breakfast buffet in the hotel in the dining room. After breakfast, we went to our rooms to get dressed for the day in short-strap shirts, shorts and skirts/dresses because it was a hot day. This was very easy for me because the rooms were so large, and it was effortless to find the things that I needed.</p>
<p align="center" >After that, we all met on the ground floor of the Hilton hotel, where we all played cards and talked a bit while waiting for the directions from the hotel to Acropolis, where we were going that day. We also waited for a wheelchair for me, which the Hilton hotel provided so that it would be quicker and easier to get to the different places for me and everyone else.</p>
<p align="center" >All of the paths we walked on were bumpy and rocky, with different routes of the floor lifted in other places, which is why we took the wheelchair to get through to the sites.</p>
<p align="center" >We walked to the ΣΤ.ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΣΜΟΥ (the metro station), which was about 300m away from the Hilton hotel; then, from there, we took the M3 to Monastiraki Metro Station, then we took about a 10-minute walk (of course I was pushed in the wheelchair by other people) to the Acropolis. :)</p>
<p align="center" >We got to the Acropolis around nine o'clock in the morning. We got to Acropolis by using the Acropolis subway station.</p>
<p align="center" >We walked to the monument entrance from the Acropolis subway station at the Acropolis. The monument entrance is the entrance to the Acropolis. Then, we took a quick visit to the Hill. We all took some photos of neoclassical architecture.</p>
<p align="center" >Neoclassical architecture is a style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century. Neoclassical architecture is straightforward and symmetrical. We then visited the monuments, where we took a lot of photos. We then visited two different sites aside from the pedestrian road. </p>
<p align="center" >One of the sites includes the Dionysus Theater, a major theatre in Athens, considered the world's first theatre, built at the foot of the Athenian Acropolis. The New Acropolis Museum is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site of the Acropolis of Athens.</p>
<p align="center" >We had some ice cream somewhere local; then we walked to Agora. We had ice cream there because we were sweltering, and it was a scorching hot day. We stayed at Agora for about an hour, then walked to the Monastiraki flea market. We then stayed at the need for a while to eat somewhere local. Then we took the metro from Monastiraki station to the Hilton. We bought different things at the flea market while I was in the wheelchair (I went to some stalls which I didn't want to go to and some booths that I wish I had gone to). Still, it all worked out by being as quick as everyone else. </p>
<p align="center" >We had a big dinner at a local Greek restaurant near the Hilton Hotel. After we had eaten dinner, we walked back to the Hilton hotel, where we talked, and after, we went to our rooms to go to sleep.</p>
<p align="center" >On the next day, we visited Panathenaic Stadium and the National Gardens (Of course, I had the wheelchair with me again, but the wheelchair prevented me from walking to different places, which I did want to do). We woke up at eight in the morning; we went to breakfast to eat and headed to the metro station by walking, where some of us (the ones who couldn't walk quickly) took a taxi.</p>
<p align="center" >We then walked to the stadium from the metro. The Panathenaic Stadium is one of the main historic attractions of Athens; it is the only stadium in the world built entirely of marble. So we stayed to take pictures of the stadium (which had many stairs, so it was hard to get up the steps in a wheelchair/walker with different leg strengths and disabilities).</p>
<p align="center" >We also got a pair of headphones, a brochure containing information about the stadium and an audio guide device. The audio guide device had a lot of knowledgeable information about the stadium, how it was built, and where it was placed. After this, the four boys raced against each other around the whole track (which was fun to see, all the different speeds). :)</p>
<p align="center" > We walked southwest towards the Leof Vasileos Alexandrou. The admission fee is generally 5 euros but 2.50 euros for students. So, I was still pushed in the wheelchair while everyone was walking. After this, all of us climbed to the upper tier of Stand 21; from there, we could capture pictures of the Acropolis, the Parthenon, Filopappos Hill, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, and Zappeion and the National Gardens and Lycabettus Hill. </p>
<p align="center" >After this, we went to take a picnic at the national gardens, and we relaxed there for a couple of hours while I sat comfortably in the wheelchair. Then we walked back to the hotel and rested till dinner because it had been a very long day. We also packed before and after dinner because we went to Crete the next day.</p>
<p align="center" >We spent the day swimming, relaxing and packing the day after. At noon, we started to get ready to go to the airport to board the flight to Crete Airport.</p>
<p align="center" >After leaving the hotel in Athens, we didn't get the wheelchair since the hotel gave us a wheelchair. So in the airport, I used the walker to move around after getting a wheelchair from the airport, which was challenging to get. When we reached the Crete Hotel, I thoroughly used my walker.</p>
<p align="center" >We got to the Crete Hotel at about three o'clock in the afternoon. The Crete Hotel was very accessible to disabled people. When we got to the Crete Hotel, we met the people in the Pamoja group, six other families, and 18 people. Many people stayed in the hotel. This was our third Pamoja altogether.</p>
<p align="center" >When we arrived at the hotel, we were the first people in the group who came, so we all spent some time sitting on the couch in the reception where we talked until the others reached the hotel from the airport. The hotel had a big glass elevator that was see-through and could open from both sides of the elevator.</p>
<p align="center" >When the others arrived at the airport at the hotel, we all went to dinner to eat a lot of food. There was a big dinner, and in the restaurant, there was an extensive buffet with various foods. Getting the food with both hands on the walker while getting it into the plates was tough. We spent about seven days at the hotel for a holiday.</p>
<p align="center" > The hotel had three large swimming pools. One of the pools was for children to play in, which had a lot of water slides, and the other was for swimming or relaxing in the pool. All the collections were easy to get into. In one of the pools used for swimming, there was a sidebar on the edge of it where many people would get a drink and relax in the water. We played water polo in the pool and had a lot of fun.</p>
<p align="center" > The hotel had a beach nearby. It was very well established, and the public/tourists came to the beach, but the beach wasn't very disability accessible or close to the hotel; many people were around the hotel and in the hotel. It had a lot of seaside chairs and umbrellas. We had to go down the stairs to get to the beach, which was a bit hard, considering I had a walker. The beach also had hot, yellow sand, great for frequent visitors/tourists. There was a great big ocean, and the sea had many people swimming in it.</p>
<p align="center" > We had breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. For these meals, we could either go to the main dining area, a small bar/restaurant above the main dining area or another small cafe/restaurant near the swimming pools (where there were steep steps or a steep uphill, which were both hard to get up to the cafe/restaurant). </p>
<p align="center" >The main dining room had a buffet of many different choices of food: fruits, cereals, pieces of bread, sausages, pastries, eggs and other foods for breakfast. For lunch, the dining room had a range of foods: pasta dishes, meat dishes, roasted dishes and salad dishes. For dinner, the dining room had a range of foods similar to the content of foods at lunch. The main dining room had an extensive buffet with some waiters/waitresses asking for some food that was not there in the buffet. </p>
<p align="center" >We once went to the bar/restaurant above the main dining area for dinner. We ordered a meal beforehand, which was to fit our preferences. We went to the cafe/restaurant near the swimming pools where we ordered the food, so it wasn't like a buffet, but we ate most of our meals in the main dining room. There were long flights of stairs to go to the main dining area. Therefore I took the elevator. I prefer the main dining room with the buffet more than the other places.</p>
<p align="center" >The teenagers/kids played some games each night while the adults talked about different events and things. The games that we played included: spoons, poker and a few other games.</p>
<p align="center" >On one of the days, the adults and teenagers/kids discussed if anyone wanted to visit a place and see where we wanted to go. On another night, we all sat down and played an exciting card game called Mafia. On another day, we visited a water park where many water slides and different pools. Still, there were many stairs, which weren't very accessible. We had lunch at a restaurant/cafe near the water park. The park was entertaining and enjoyable for everyone there. The water park and water slides were huge for everyone who was there.</p>
<p align="center" >After that, we went on to the public bus to return to the hotel. Once we got to the hotel, we went to another big pool. The bar next to the swimming pool was where the teenagers/kids usually played games and discussed different things. While in the pool, we found some giant inflatable floats to lie on in the pools; there were many floats, like straight floats and ringed floats. We played water polo with everyone there, and a couple of people from outside the group joined us to play the game.</p>
<p align="center" >There were football, basketball and volleyball courts (all the courts were up one to two steps, so this part was not disability accessible). We spent most of the time on the football and volleyball courts. The kids all spent time on the football court playing a lot. The adults and kids on the volleyball court play kabaddi, Khor and volleyball each day.</p>
<p align="center" >Two to three (including me) of us took photos and videos of the group of people. The Kabaddi was fun for everyone. In Kabaddi, my two brothers played on either team against each other, and one of the brothers ripped the other brother's t-shirt (the shirt was torn and broken). It was so funny; everyone laughed so much. Choosing people who would be in each team for each game was hard, but we made all the teams.</p>
<p align="center" >I was one of the people watching the people play the games and the person taking photographs of them playing the different games to keep the memories of us all.</p>
<p align="center" > We all went one day to a museum in Crete, Greece. The museum was massive, and we went around to see all the different artefacts, which was good but tiring. We were all drained and exhausted from walking around the museum.</p>
<p align="center" >On the last day, we all had breakfast together and played cards and poker. In the afternoon, we all headed to the Crete airport (at different times) and the flight to the Greece Airport, which took about one to two hours. We then went to the various gates to get to our houses. </p>
<p align="center" >The people who lived in Kenya went from the Greece Airport to the Nairobi Airport, Kenya. The people who lived in England went from Greece Airport to Heathrow Airport, England (including my family). ​</p>
