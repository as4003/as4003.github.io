    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to France when my mum and I went to Paris for a week.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 20, my mother and I went on our first trip alone (just the two of us). I took my wheelchair to make seeing more sites easier for me and my mum. We were staying in a Hotel, while in Paris. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to get the train to take us to the airport; we felt excited but also a bit terrified of whether we could cope on this trip. We only took one main luggage, with two rucksacks as hand luggage and my wheelchair. As soon as we arrived at the airport, we checked in and went to the lounge to relax till boarding the flight. We also got a chance to grab some food to get ready for the flight.</p>
<p align="center" >Once getting onto the flight, we sat together, and we were able to have a good flight together when resting. When we reached the Paris airport, we got greeted with a wheelchair and headed to baggage claim to pick up our luggage. Once we collected the bags, we headed to the arrivals gate to get a taxi to the hotel.</p>
<p align="center" >We reached the hotel in under an hour and went in; the receptionist greeted us. We were told the wheelchair wouldn't be able to fit in the elevator, so we kept the chair in their closet; we then collected the key and headed to our room. The room had a cupboard, a double bed and an accessible bathroom (I was shocked by this). We got to the room at about 10 pm; there were a lot of Vietnamese places nearby to get dinner from. Once we reached, I was too exhausted to go out; my mum decided to go down to the Vietnamese place next door to get us dinner. My mum brought the pad thai back up to the room for us to enjoy; we then went to bed and fell asleep. We were both exhausted from the day.</p>
<p align="center" >The next day, we woke up early to get ready to go on our pre-booked tour of the Eiffel Tower. For breakfast, we ate hotel food like bread, croissants, fruits, and some dips. After breakfast, we returned to our room to get ready for the day; we then went back down to the reception to get the wheelchair and asked how we could get to the Eiffel Tower. The receptionist told us we could try getting an Uber because most metro stations weren't disability friendly. Therefore, we used our phones to get an Uber, it was big enough to fit the walker in, and we made it to the place (where the tour began) on time, where we met a group of people who were taking the tour as well as us. We were all given either a blue, yellow or red sticker.</p>
<p align="center" >My mum and I got the tour's English version, which was the red sticker. The tour was of the Eiffel Tower to the second level. We started by walking to the queue of the Eiffel Tower and queuing up. While in line, we listened to the tour guide for information about the Eiffel Tower, where we saw different images. We had to queue up for a while because a few strikers wouldn't come down to the ground level from the Eiffel Tower. Once we reached the 2nd Level of the Eiffel Tower, my mum and I went all the way around and took pictures from different heights, all around the Eiffel Tower. Once finished in the Eiffel Tower, we returned to the ground level in the lift.</p>
<p align="center" >When we left, we walked along the River Seine and the City of Paris. While passing through the city, we took many pictures of the city and went to look at different shops along the way. We then went to buy macaroons from the candy shop in the City of Paris. We went to a few places for lunch and some food. On the way, we saw many views of different artefacts and sites. We later headed to the port to go on the River Seine Cruise, we wanted to go at sunset, but it was too late. So we went to the River Seine Cruise at 8 pm, where we saw various sites, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and many other artefacts. After the one-hour River Cruise, we got an Uber to return to the hotel. Once we reached the hotel, we went to get takeout from a different restaurant and then went to bed.</p> 
<p align="center" >On the third day, we woke up early and ate breakfast. We tried to get an Uber to the Louvre Museum (where we previously booked a tour for 10 am). Still, the Uber didn't arrive (my mum was panicking a lot), so we went to ask the receptionist for information on how to get to the Louvre, and he said we should go via bus. The bus ended up being the best option for us, my mum went down the stairs to get two tickets, and we headed to the bus stop to get the bus. The bus had wheelchair access, which was very convenient, we were already late for the Louvre tour, but luckily they let us in, and we took the lift down to the main floor. We went to many exhibits in the museum; I took pictures of everything in the museum with the chance of my mum taking selfies of us. We had to go around the museum to find the Mona Lisa. We got a chance to pass the queue and look at the Mona Lisa up close, where we could take pictures and selfies to read more information about the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p align="center" >After leaving the Louvre museum, we walked around the city, taking the night tour bus at 7 pm. At 7 pm, we returned to the Louvre museum to take pictures and go on the night tour bus. My mum and I got to go to the top of the bus to see the city artefacts and different shops. When this ended, we reached the Louvre at 11 pm; when there, we saw the lights of the Louvre, where we took many pictures, and had a chance to get the bus back to the hotel. We ate some snacks and fell asleep when we got to the hotel. </p>
<p align="center" >On the fourth day, we woke up later, where we had a few snacks and then headed to the Montparnasse Tower to see the perfect view of the city, with the Eiffel Tower and all the other artefacts of the City of Paris. After this, we walked to the Luxembourg Gardens to have some bread, cheese and rose wine from a nearby cafe. Me and my mum I each had half a bottle of rose wine. Later, we headed to the bus stop to return to the hotel, where we chilled out. Once we got to the hotel, we went to get dinner from the nearby restaurant; we then relaxed and packed to get ready for the trip back home. </p>
<p align="center" >On the fifth day, we woke up and packed till we left the hotel to go across the road to the cafe for a good breakfast and enjoy a good croissant. We went onto the bus to leave for the airport. On the way, we went to a cafe to get a macaroon and a drink for me and my mum to prepare for the flight. We reached the airport and got ready for the flight home.</p>
<p align="center" >I had a great holiday, when travelling with my mother to Paris. Most of all, I enjoyed spending time and talking to my mum about many different topics. We had a lot of challenges along the way, but we enjoyed it all.</p>
