<p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Thailand with my family and what we did whilst there.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 13, me and my family went to Thailand. I took my wheelchair because I didn't use my walker often. It made our plans of what we wanted to do and where to go much easier. </p>
<p align="center" >We left home to leave for the airport. At the airport, we unloaded our bags, and then we left the car to go to the check-in, where we were told to go into the fast lane for the security check. We then waited to board the flight. On the plane, we saw many movies on the screens. After many hours, we arrived at the Thailand Airport, where we got onto the bus to the baggage claim, got the bags, and took a taxi to the hotel.</p>
<p align="center" >We got two rooms in the hotel, one for my brothers and one for my parents and me. We arrived in the morning and had enough time to see the city and shop. We went to many different places to see historical artefacts. We then left to spend more time in the market square while shopping for different items. After going to the market, we spent a lot of time in the hotel, until going to the restaurant for dinner and some food. After dinner, we decided where to go tomorrow, and we decided to do a range of different activities. </p>
<p align="center" >On another day, we did many different activities, which were very enjoyable. We took a taxi to an adventure park at the start of the day. My brothers and dad went quad biking in the adventure park, which looked exciting and fun. After, we all went ziplining (which was exciting and fun for me to do). Fortunately, we had a great harness and leader to take us to the zipline point. After we left for kayaking along the stream, I went with my dad; we enjoyed ourselves a lot of the time. Later, we returned to the hotel for dinner and talked about what to do the next day. </p> 
<p align="center" >On one of the days, we left early to go to a marketplace with a stream of different markets. As soon as we got there, we got into a rowing boat and went through the floating market, where we saw many stalls and different artefacts of the country. It was tough for me to sit on the boat, but it was easier to get down onto the rowing boat when holding my family's hands. On this boat ride, we had a enjoyable time looking at different things. After the boat ride, we visited the museum and many temples to see some statues. We got to take many images and videos with our cameras. After going to the temples, we left to look for a place to go to dinner. We then left to go to the airport and go back home. </p>
<p align="center" >This was a great visit, where we enjoyed the adventures taken throughout the trip with the chance to talk to my brother and parents.</p>
