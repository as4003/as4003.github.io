    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about my trip to Italy when I went to Rome for a week with my parents.</strong> </p>
<br>
<p align="center" >When I was 19, I went to Rome, Italy, with my parents. During this trip, I took my manual wheelchair.</p>
<p align="center" >We left home to go to the train station in the morning. We parked near the lift to go up to the platform with the bags and wheelchair, where we got onto the train using a ramp for the wheelchair, which the train station provided. Â Once we got to the airport, we went to baggage claim and security check. After, we went to a few shops and restaurants to get food and eat. The flight was very delayed but comfortable.</p>
<p align="center" >When we landed in Rome, the flight assistants told us to wait at the front of the plane for the wheelchair. However, as this was taking too long (miscommunication between the two airport staff), We descended the stairs from the plane. This worked as somebody guided me down the stairs. Everyone else went onto the bus from the plane to go to the airport, but we went into a minibus with my wheelchair there to be able to get inside the Terminal.</p>
<p align="center" >The Rome airport was surprisingly very accessible; we went to get the bags from baggage claim, then went to the train station via the elevator. Once we went to the train station, we got onto the train, but they didn't have ramps to get the wheelchair onto the train, so I had to get out of my wheelchair to get onto the train. While I was on the train, I sat in my wheelchair while my parents sat near the bags to look after them.</p>
<p align="center" >We got to the train station, near the hotel, where we came off the train at our Terminal with the help of lifting the wheelchair. We then went through the shopping centre in the train station; the pathway in the area was apparent and smooth. We headed straight to the hotel with all our bags, but the road and path were very bumpy and rocky, with the wheelchair wobbling all the time during the whole holiday. When we got to the hotel, we saw there were steps to go through the hotel entrance and reception. Although there was a wheelchair lift if I couldn't get out of the wheelchair. We then went to the reception to get our room key and up in the elevator. Once we found our room, we unpacked our bags and redressed to prepare for dinner at a restaurant near our hotel. We went to dinner and ate pasta with pizza; we drank a lot of water and talked about what we would do after dinner.</p>
<p align="center" >We chose to go to the Fontana de Trevi (Trevi Fountain). On the way there, the wheelchair did a lot of rattling, which was very uncomfortable. Many people were in the area, and it was difficult to see the fountain; there was an arena of seats around it. There were also a few steps to go down to see the fountain, where I had to get out of the wheelchair to look at the place clearly and take more pictures. We decided to take a taxi back to the hotel because it was late at night and discomforting to be in a wheelchair. Once we reached the hotel, we kept the wheelchair in the reception and went up to the room to go to sleep.</p>
<p align="center" >On the second day, we dressed to prepare breakfast, where we could have a very balanced meal. While eating, we discussed what we would do that day; we suggested visiting the Colosseum and the area. The Colosseum is a famous theatre. We walked there, which took us around half an hour, via the road and path being very uneven, whilst the wheelchair was jiggling. The area was very cool, and the surroundings were smooth and stable. The Colosseum had a lift to get to the other floors and see the arena inside.</p>
<p align="center" >Once we left the Colosseum, we went to the shade to relax and drink water. Afterwards, we planned to go to the Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum; but once we were at the top of the hill, we saw that it would be hard to go down and up the hill with the wheelchair. So I stayed up the hill in the wheelchair, taking pictures while my parents looked at the site distinctly. Once they got back, we all wanted to return to the hotel, but there wasn't a gate for the wheelchair exit, so we had to look for another way to get the wheelchair out of the area. On the way to the hotel, it was unsteady, but we stopped at a restaurant where we ate a lot of pizza for lunch and rested. We got back to the hotel and had a very relaxing break in the room. When we went out for dinner, we got a glimpse of the Pantheon temple.</p>
<p align="center" >On the third day, we went to the Pantheon temple to learn more about the Roman temple. The path towards the area was very unlevel and rough. Once we reached, we found out that we needed tickets, but they said that one person could go in with a person in a wheelchair, so we only got one ticket. Gladly, there was a steady entrance for a wheelchair. When we entered the temple, the area's flooring was very surface and straight, so I had a chance to wheel myself around to look at everything on my own. Once we had looked around and taken photos, we decided to eat lunch; we then got some gelato and headed to the Spanish Steps.</p>
<p align="center" >We sat near a fountain; near the place, to view the area. Although I wanted to go up the stairs, I was afraid to fall. Therefore, I stayed at the bottom of the stairs while my parents went up and down the steps with me, taking pictures. Later, we left the area and returned to the hotel to relax before dinner. Once we got to the hotel, we got dressed and had a rest with discussing where we would eat dinner.</p>
<p align="center" > We visited the Vatican Museum and Sistine Chapel on the fourth day. We went through Sistine Chapel and saw all the different artefacts, with the audio tour guide to explain every area of the chapel. Many lifts were located in different areas of the chapel (which was very helpful to enter and find where to go). This led us to the Vatican Museum, where we met someone to give a tour for us and a group of four more people. When entering the Vatican Museum, I got to see the different artefacts of the Virgin Mary and people in the bible; we also saw the candlelights and many types of stained glass. I chose to wheel myself in my wheelchair (which was a bit slower, but I felt that I could do it on my own).</p>
<p align="center" >On the fifth day, we were on our way back home; we reached the airport in Rome, and we got a chance to get some food and snacks. We boarded the flight and got back home in a good amount of time.</p>
<p align="center" >We enjoyed the trip to Rome and had a great time when visiting all the artefacts of Rome.
