    <p align="center" > <strong>This is about how I did in my NCS.</strong> </p>
<br>
<ul>
<p align="center" >NCS stands for the National Citizen Service, normally for four weeks, but I did it for three weeks. I had to go online to find an NCS Event, which is for three weeks, to be able to attend the first part of my holiday. My secondary school had some people come to advertise it. Although I did it away from home, for a shorter time to go on holiday, most of my friends were doing NCS near where I lived. I was there to grow my confidence and independence, hoping to gain more friendships. I was there to enlarge my skills and achievements</p>
<p align="center" >I did my NCS in Harlow, which made me very nervous about being around people, I didn't know. The first Week is for Adventure Week, the second is for a University visit, and the third is a Charity and Presentation type of Week. We left for Harlow College to meet everyone, go on the NCS adventure and get ready to go to the outdoor activities place. There was only one other girl, while the rest were boys. After we got to the college, we got onto the coach for each Week, where there were four helpers each Week.</p>
<p align="center" >On the first Week was Adventure Week, where there were many tree-top challenges with many obstacles and activities. On the nights while we were there, I stayed in a cabin with the other girl, while there were four boys in each of the other cabins. We did many outdoor activities together, like rock climbing, ziplining, etc. We also did some team-building exercises with different roping activities. At lunch and dinner, we ate in the cafeteria and met up in the hut with everyone in the Harlow team to talk and play card games. Each night, we had a campfire, where we had smores and roasted marshmallows (Honestly, it was my first time eating smores, and I enjoyed them). After five days, we headed back to Harlow College and made our way back home.</p>
<p align="center" >On the second Week was University Week, where we went to the university and learned about university life. I spent five days in a University room at ground level, which was very easy to get to. We did many different exercises to learn what to do in university and the classes. We all ate in different places while playing cards with friends in a friend's room. When we were there, I made many friendships and met a few people I knew from Stevenage. We had many movie and team nights to do fun things. We all went to the Gymnasium in the university one time, where we played football and basketball</p>
<p align="center" >On the third Week, it was Charity and Presentation Week, where we went to the college to raise money for a nearby hospice. We spent the five days in Harlow College, where I went home after each day. In the college, we held different events to raise money for the hospice, like an event for people to pay to play PS4 Games. We also set up a stall to give out donated snacks and raffle tickets to earn money for charity. On one of the days, we went to town to give out wristbands and raise awareness for the hospice. At the end of the Week, we prepared a presentation to give to tell the parents about our adventure</p>
<p align="center" > In these weeks, we all improved many skills, such as Confidence, Independence, Motivation, Teamwork Skills, Organisation, Navigation, and Communication Skills with the key to making friends.</p>
